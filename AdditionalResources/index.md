# Additional Resources

*   [Schema.org Blog](http://blog.schema.org)  Since April 2015, the W3C [Schema.org Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg) is the main forum for schema collaboration, and provides the [public-schemaorg@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/) mailing list for discussions. Schema.org issues are tracked [on GitHub](http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues).  
\
Earlier discussions can be found in W3C's [public-vocabs](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/) group. There was also a [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/schemaorg-discussion) used during 2011.

*   **Community discussions:** the [W3C Web Schemas group](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas) hosted a collection of [proposals](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/SchemaDotOrgProposals) for additions and improvements to schema.org. Since 2014 detailed discussions have been managed through [github](http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues), and coordinated via the [W3C Schema.org Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg).
*   A custom **[search](http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=003736913799082383568:c44bi0_xxek)** across all these discussions and sites is also available.
*   **[General feedback form](feedback.html):** Please give us feedback, report bugs, etc. For technical feedback, [GitHub](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues) is preferred.
